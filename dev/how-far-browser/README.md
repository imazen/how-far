# Browser integration tests

This isolated application tests `how-far` with pinned bindings,
`wasm-bindgen 0.2.123` and `wasm-bindgen-rayon 1.3` (`no-bundler`), a
worker-owned Rayon pool, and shared Wasm memory. It is excluded from ordinary
workspace builds, so none of its browser dependencies reach either library.
The fixture uses `how-far-along` with `std,json` and explicitly depends on
`how-far-really` for profiling.

```sh
rustup toolchain install nightly-2026-09-02 --component rust-src
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain stable
cargo +stable install wasm-bindgen-cli --version 0.2.123 --locked
bash dev/how-far-browser/build.sh
cargo +stable build --manifest-path dev/how-far-wasm/Cargo.toml --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
cd dev/how-far-browser
npm ci
npx playwright install --with-deps chromium webkit
npm test
```

Set `HOW_FAR_BINDGEN` if the matching CLI is installed outside `PATH`. Only
this threaded Wasm application needs nightly and `build-std`; the libraries
build on stable Rust (`enough` on 1.85, the how-far crates on 1.88).

The HTTP server supplies COOP/COEP headers. Tests run in Chromium and Playwright
WebKit and verify:

* Serial preparation, a four-worker Rayon phase, join, and serial output.
* Nonblocking UI-thread snapshots while workers report, retrying busy reads on
  a later event-loop turn, including actual DOM updates.
* UI-thread cancellation through shared Rust control while the owner Worker is
  inside a synchronous encode-like loop; no cancel message handler is required.
* Stable terminal counts after every worker has joined.
* Std-backed profiler state on a Worker with a JavaScript clock, and nonblocking
  trace observations on the UI.
* Main-thread event-loop turns and cancellation using JSPI where available, and
  a resumable chunk adapter on engines without native stack suspension.

The WebKit tests exercise a WebKit engine, not Apple's packaged Safari browser.
The compute loop models a codec's asymmetric scheduling; it does not compile or
port a production codec. Asyncify transforms and arbitrary wasm-bindgen closure
trampolines are not covered. The JSPI test uses the raw Wasm import/export probe
so its suspension boundary is explicit.
