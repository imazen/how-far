///
/// Splitting and counting are exclusive: a phase either counts its own units

/// Wrappers that add measurement or forwarding implement this trait, so it is
/// open. Methods added in later compatible releases will have default bodies.

/// # Implementing
///
/// A tracker or checkpoint callback adapter from `how-far-along` usually
/// suffices. Implementations must keep these rules:
///
/// - `check` and `advance` may run on many threads at once, and `advance` must
///   not block. `may_stop` and `may_report` return `false` only when that can
///   never change.
/// - `split` starts with [`PhaseSpec::validate_split`]. It fails with
///   [`PlanError::AlreadyInUse`] if this phase already counted work or split,
///   and otherwise returns one [`Child::new`] per part, in order, each
///   checking and counting like any pulse. Children from [`Child::inert`]
///   cannot be stopped or observed, so they suit only parts nobody watches.
/// - [`share`](Self::share) returns an owned view that checks the same stop,
///   counts into the same phase and plans its children, or fails with
///   [`PlanError::NotShareable`]; it never silently drops cancellation.
/// - [`ChildPulse::finish`] fails with [`PlanError::UnfinishedChildren`] while
