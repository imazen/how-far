//! Measure how often work checks for cancellation and reports progress.
//!
//! Create one [`Span`] per logical task or chunk, then wrap that task's stop
//! policy or progress sink with [`Span::instrument`]. The wrapper records every
//! check and report at its original call site. One span per task matters: a
//! single span shared by a pool would let one busy worker hide another
//! worker's long silence. Separate span kinds record queueing, joins, host
//! suspensions, and callbacks.
//!
//! Durations are wall time, **not CPU time**, read from the [`Clock`] you
//! supply. Retention is bounded, and anything dropped is counted in every
//! export. The collector uses OS mutexes, so it requires `std`; it belongs on
//! native threads or browser workers. Browser UI readers use
//! [`Profiler::try_snapshot`].
//!
//! # Stability
//!
//! The record types ([`Trace`], [`SpanRecord`], [`Stats`], [`SiteStats`],
//! [`ReportGap`], ...) are `#[non_exhaustive]` with public fields. Later
//! releases may add fields but will not rename, retype or remove them. JSON
//! from [`Trace::write_json`] follows the same rule: readers must ignore keys
//! they do not know, and `schema_version` changes only if a key is removed or
//! its meaning changes.
