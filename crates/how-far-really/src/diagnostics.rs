//! Checkpoint advice for library tests, normally used as a dev-dependency.

//! check, long stretches without a report, very hot call sites, slow or
//! irregular callbacks, stage weights that differ from measured time,
//! phases whose units slow down or speed up partway, and stages to declare
//! in a phase whose checkpoints run in separate stretches.
